## Information We Collect
When connecting to our radio stream, your IP address will be sent to our radio service provider in order for us to track listening trends and provide licensing bodies with royalty reports. Once our service provider receives your IP it is immediately anonymised, deleted and becomes untraceable. This data is never sold on or passed to other companies. 

The Pocket Radio FM iOS App does not collect any user data when installed or launched on your device.
